Hi, I'm Luke Aunger
I have completed a degree in Computer science and software development.
I have an interest in coding and problem solving which the two go hand in hand.
What I have here is a Portfolio of all my projects that I have completed during my time at University and in my spare time.
I am hoping to build more projects on different areas in development and expand my knowledge to better understand how all things work.
Should you wish to contact me, email at: LukeAunger@Gmail.com

Many thanks
