Hello

My name is Luke Aunger and this profile is a collection of code that I worked on during uni and in my spare time.
I have obtained a Degree in Bsc Hons Computing and Software development obtaining a 2:1 and have worked with various languages
like C#, .NET, Javascript, Node.JS and Python. I am currently looking at tech based roles and looking for work in a challenging
and interesting environment where I can learn even more.

Thanks for taking a look.
